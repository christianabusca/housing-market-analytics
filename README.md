# 🏠 Housing Price Analysis

An exploratory data analysis project investigating what factors drive residential property prices using the Kaggle House Prices dataset.

## 📋 About This Project

This project analyzes 1,460 residential properties to answer: **"What makes houses expensive?"**

I explored the relationship between house prices and various features like size, quality, location, and age using Python data analysis tools.

## 🔍 Key Findings

**Top 5 Factors That Affect Price:**
1. Overall Quality (correlation: 0.79)
2. Living Area Size (correlation: 0.71)
3. Garage Capacity (correlation: 0.64)
4. Garage Area (correlation: 0.62)
5. Basement Size (correlation: 0.61)

**Interesting Discoveries:**
- Houses with 0 bedrooms averaged $221K (higher than 1-6 bedroom homes!)
- Northridge neighborhood is 3.4x more expensive than Meadow Village
- Homes built after 2000 cost almost double those from the 1900s
- Price distribution is right-skewed with most houses around $150K-$180K

## 📈 Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration** - Loaded and examined the dataset
2. **Price Distribution** - Analyzed price patterns and outliers
3. **Feature Relationships** - Studied correlations with price
4. **Location Analysis** - Compared neighborhood effects
5. **Visualization** - Created charts and dashboard

## 💻 How to Run

This project was created using **Kaggle Notebooks**.

**To view/run the notebook:**
1. Visit the [Kaggle House Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
2. Download `train.csv` from the Data tab
3. Open the notebook in Kaggle or Jupyter
4. Update the file path to your dataset location
5. Run the cells sequentially


## 📊 Visualizations

The project includes:
- Price distribution histogram
- Scatter plots showing relationships
- Neighborhood comparison bar charts
- Correlation heatmap
- Summary dashboard combining key insights

## 💡 What I Learned

- **Quality matters most** - Overall quality is the strongest price predictor
- **Location creates huge differences** - Same house can be 3x more expensive in different neighborhoods
- **Size and price are strongly related** - But there's still lots of variation
- **Newer homes cost more** - Modern construction commands premium prices
- **More bedrooms ≠ higher price** - Quality and location matter more than bedroom count

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Build a machine learning model to predict house prices
- Try different regression algorithms
- Feature engineering for better predictions
- Create an interactive dashboard
